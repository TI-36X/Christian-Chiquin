	<p style="text-indent: 40px">I was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Currently, I am 20 years old and am attending Tulsa Community College majoring in Computer engineering. I enjoy running, playing with my dog, and playing soccer. I play lead guitar in the worship band at Eastwood Baptist, and I occasionally work in the youth group. I went to Booker T. Washington High School as well as Tulsa Tech. At Tech, I studied how to be a maintenance technician, where I learned a lot of things such as hydraulics, pnuematics, PLC's and Arduinos.</p>
	<br>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px">In the summer of 2019, I got married to my beautiful wife Taylor, and together we still reside in Tulsa. That summer I also took my first programming class, an online Python course that I needed for college. That fall, I took a course that taught me how to code in C. While I didn't dislike programming, it was hard for me to appreciate it's true power while trying to get through my other courses. Truthfully, it wasn't until the beginning of 2020 that I really began to want to learn how to program on my own, and realized what all can be done through the power of programming. I decided that I wanted to learn web development, and I began teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which I used to build this website.
